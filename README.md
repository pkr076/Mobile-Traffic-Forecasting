# Mobile-Traffic-Forecasting
This report analyses `Telecommunications Activity' dataset which has data recorded as measure of the
level of interaction between the users and the mobile phone network. Specifically, it analyses `Internet
traffic activity' of the dataset which represents the number of CDRs (Call Detail Records) generated
inside a given area (square Id) during a given time. After analysis of data, Random Forest model is
trained which tries to forecast the future internet traffic.
